Difficult: 2/3

A person has been murdered on Halloween night 🔪. Using a spell 🧙‍♀️, we managed to hear their last whisper but it is very weak and doesn't allow us to identify who might have been the killer.

The information it provides us:

whisper: string representing what the victim tried to say before dying

suspects: list of strings representing the names of all the suspects.

We have to keep in mind that the whisper whisper has some rules:

Each ~ represents an uncertain letter in the whisper.
Each position in the whisper corresponds to a position in the killer's name.
The length of the whisper doesn't always represent the full length of the name, as the victim might have died before finishing saying it.
But if the last character of the whisper is a $, then the killer's name ended there.
Your goal is to find out who could be the killer! You must return:

If only one name matches the whisper pattern, return that name.
If there are multiple names that match, return all names separated by commas.
If no name matches, return an empty string ("").
Letter case doesn't matter.

const whisper = 'd~~~~~a';
const suspects = ['Dracula', 'Freddy Krueger', 'Jason Voorhees', 'Michael Myers'];

findTheKiller(whisper, suspects); // -> 'Dracula'

const whisper2 = '~r~dd~';
const suspects2 = ['Freddy', 'Freddier', 'Fredderic']

findTheKiller(whisper2, suspects2); // -> 'Freddy,Freddier,Fredderic'

const whisper3 = '~r~dd$';
const suspects3 = ['Freddy', 'Freddier', 'Fredderic']

findTheKiller(whisper3, suspects3); // -> ''

const whisper4 = 'mi~~def';
const suspects4 = ['Midudev', 'Midu', 'Madeval']

findTheKiller(whisper4, suspects4); // -> ''
