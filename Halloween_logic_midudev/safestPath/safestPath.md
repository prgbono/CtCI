Difficult: 2/3

You are trapped in a nightmare where Freddy Krueger is chasing you 😭. The dream is represented by a maze of cells, where each cell has a numeric value indicating the danger level of that part of the dream.

You must find the safest path (i.e., the one with the lowest total danger value) from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the matrix.

In this challenge, you can only move right or down (you cannot move back or diagonally), and you must calculate the total danger level of the safest path.

The nightmare is represented by an n x m matrix called dream where each cell is a positive number representing the danger level of that cell in the dream.

And you have to return the total danger value of the safest path from the top-left corner (position [0][0]) to the bottom-right corner (position [n-1][m-1]).

const dream = [
  [1, 3, 1],
  [1, 5, 1],
  [4, 2, 1],
]

// ToBeRemoved ----------------------------------------------------------------
[
  [1, 3, 1],
]
// ToBeRemoved ----------------------------------------------------------------

const bestPath = findSafestPath(dream) // Returns 7
// The safest path is:
// [0, 0] -> 1
// [0, 1] -> 3
// [0, 2] -> 1
// [1, 2] -> 1
// [2, 2] -> 1

// 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 = 7
